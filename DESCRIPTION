Description: An R wrapper of the 'Inform' v1.0.0 C library for performing
      information analysis of complex systems. As for the 'Inform' library, 'rinform' is
      structured around the concepts of: 1) discrete empirical probability distributions,
      which form the basis for all of the information-theoretic measures; 2) classic
      information-theoretic measures built upon empirical distributions; and 3) measures of
      information dynamics for time series. In addition to the core components, 'rinform'
      also provides a collection of utilities to manipulate time series.
