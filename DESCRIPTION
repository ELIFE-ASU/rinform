Description: An R wrapper of the Inform v1.0.0 C library for performing
      information analysis of complex systems. As for the Inform library, rinform is
      structured around the concepts of: 1) discrete emperical probability distributions,
      which form the basis for all of the information-theoretic measures; 2) classic
      information-theoretic measures built upon empirical distributions; and 3) measures of
      information dynamics for time series. In addition to the core components, rinform also
      provides a small collection of utilities to deal with time series.
