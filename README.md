An R wrapper of the [Inform v1.0.0](https://elife-asu.github.io/Inform/) C library for performing information analysis of complex system. As for the Inform library, _rinform_ is structured around the concepts of:

* discrete empirical probability distributions which form the basis for
  all of the information-theoretic measures,
* classic information-theoretic measures built upon empirical distributions (e.g.,
  Shannon entropy, mutual information, cross entropy),
* advanced measures of information dynamics for time series (e.g., transfer entropy,
  active information, evidence of integration).
  
In addition to the core components, rinform also provides a small collection of utilities
to deal with time series (e.g., binning of continuous values, black-boxing of time series).

Installation instructions and documentation for the _rinform_ package as well as
information about related projects can be found in the online
[documentation](https://elife-asu.github.io/rinform/).
